NAME
       Xed - The Text Editor

SYNOPSIS
       xed [OPTIONS...] [FILES...]

DESCRIPTION
       Xed  is  the  official text editor of the X-APPS project, which aims to
       provide applications to the Cinnamon, MATE  and  Xfce  desktops.  While
       aiming at simplicity and ease of use, Xed is a powerful general purpose
       text editor. It can be used to create and edit all sorts of text files.

       Xed features a flexible plugin system which can be used to  dynamically
       add new advanced features to Xed itself.

       This manual page briefly documents the xed command.

OPTIONS
       filename(s)...
              Specifies the file to open when xed starts. If this is not spec‐
              ified, xed will start a new, blank file with an  "Unsaved  Docu‐
              ment"  label. Multiple files can be loaded if they are separated
              by spaces. xed also supports handling of remote files.
